# ImportantForSWE Repo
The main repository for adding and maintaining important links for all software engineers in different fields.

## Updating down the road...
I'm a software engineer myself and sometimes I don't find time to always maintain it, However there will be regular updating to the repository.
Also any help is welcomed!
